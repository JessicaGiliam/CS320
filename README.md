How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Using secure design patterns is one way that I ensure my code is functional and secure. Knowing what functions cause design vulnerabilities and avoiding insecure design patterns is another way. I practice according to industry standard, use available security tools and frequently update my software. This includes but is not limited to proper storage and protection of passwords, encryption of files and database, and ensuring that access is restricted to only those who are authorized.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

One of the most important tools of interpretation is effective communication. By reading, listening, and understanding what the needs are, I can thoroughly and accurately incorporate them. Realistic expectations, pros, cons, and alternative plans should also be discussed to ensure the the user is getting the most out of their product. It's important to understand the full vision of the user. 


How do I approach designing software?

I tend to approach design of software and most everthing in life with a 'bottom-up' approach. The statement in my head repeats itself "nothing is quality if placed on unstable foundation". Growing up as the child of a person who constructed homes, I use this way of thinking frequently. I have the full understanding that at times it might be the harder way to go when creating software. The bottom-up mentality can also be practiced while using agile, RAD, dev-ops or waterfall approach. There is no way that is correct all the time for everything. I believ ethe approach should be based on what the product is and what the requirements are in order to provide a successful project.
